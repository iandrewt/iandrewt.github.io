Shipping a small library is great, but shipping a small library without dependencies is even greater.

I was recently building [commons-validator-es], a port of [Apache Commons Validator][apache-commons] to ES6, and went down the rabbit hole of making sure my port passes all the tests from the Java version.
[commons-validator-js] (the original port of `commons-validator EmailValidator` to Javascript) curiously had a few tests commented out regarding validating unicode/punycode domain names, and I wasn't going to give up that easy.

Given the `punycode` library Wix was using wasn't passing the tests, I started looking for alternate libraries. Turns out they're all huge, with [uts46] being well over 1MB! I tried implementing the punycode algorithm myself, based on this answer on [StackOverflow][so-punycode], and learned 2 things.

1. I didn't understand the problem
2. There's a reason `uts46` was huge

Turns out, there's two versions of punycode, or more specifically, IDNA. The tiny libraries were targeting IDNA2003, and the huge ones were targeting IDNA2008, the main difference between the two being a mapping algorithm. In simple terms, this ensures characters like ü are represented the same, regardless of whether the unicode was u¨ (`\u0075\u0308`) or ü (`\u00FC`). The latest version of the mapping table is a whopping `844KB`!

I was ready to accept defeat and accept that those tests might not pass, or import a huge library to compensate, when I found out the Node `url` library can do a IDNA2008 conversion natively with `domainToASCII()`.

```ts
import { domainToASCII } from 'url';

console.log(domainToASCII('\u00FC'))
// output => 'xn--tda'
```

Small problem with that though: you can't use a Node library in the browser.

But isn't the whole point of punycode/IDNA to allow domain names with unicode in the browser? Yes, yes it is.

Any browser that implements IDNA2008 will silently convert an `<a>` element with a unicode `href` to punycode for you. Simply set the `href` to `'http://' + domain` and check the elements `hostname` attribute. You can make a little helper function to do this for you

```ts
const browserToASCII = (domain: string): string => {
  const a = document.createElement('a');
  a.href = 'http://' + domain;
  return a.hostname;
};

console.log(browserToASCII('\u00FC'))
// output => 'xn--tda'
```

These two functions should save you from a very large dependency, making your library smaller and maybe even faster.

If you want to use both functions (in a client/server library), see my [next article](next-article) for two options on how to do this
